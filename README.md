## Dataset:
The FIFA 19 data set consist of information about players with features such as Age, Nationality, Club, Body Type,
value and many other important feature about a player.
The dataset can be found here:

## Summary of Findings:
From the quick descriptive statistics gotten, The minimum age of a player is 16yrs and 75% of players are below 29 yrs of age.
The maximum weight of a player is 243lbs while 50% of players have stamina rating of 66. I later went on to carry 
out univariant exploration where i looked at variables such as Weight, Age, Nationality etc. We were able to see that majority
of players are from England and the age distribution accross the dataset was rightly skewed and also the weight distribution
was normal. I went on to look for more insight on correlation with different features such as weight and finishing,
ball control and finishing, dribbling and finishing and interestingly, there was a positive correlation between dribbling
and finishing. Also, i went on to find more insight on players Body Type, value and Preferred foot and noticed that
letf footed stocky players were valued more.

## Key Insights:
I decided to look into players age, body type, nationality, wage and value for the presentation. i looked at the distribution
of players age and also Nationality, players wage and preferred foot of players using barplots.
Clustered barplots was used to look into a players value with respect to his preferred foot and despite most of the
players being right footed, left footed players are valued more.
